                <hr>
                <p>
                  I'm a 4th year CS student at University of California, Berkeley, and I'm interested in full-stack software engineering.
                  I grew up in Portland, OR, and chose to come to Berkeley in order to learn and experience new opportunities.
                  I enjoy working on challenging projects, whether alone or collaborating with a team. In my free time I enjoy
                  watching web series and playing games with friends.

                  Now that I'm a senior at UC Berkeley, I've had to opportunity to take a lot of the computer science classes here.
                  I've learned about core topics ranging from high-level (Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures) to low-level
                  (Assembly language, processor design, operating systems). I've also been able to delve into more specific topics
                  such as Operating Systems, Networks, Databases, Algorithms, AI, Design and Graphics.

                    <small>Blizzard Entertainment</small>
                    <p>
                      Interning at Blizzard was literally a dream come true for me. I met so many awesome people and learned a lot
                      about what it's like working the game industry. I worked on a project with another intern throughout the entire
                      summer, and learned many new frameworks in order to solve the problems that I encountered. The internship was
                      one of the best experiences of my life and I highly recommend it to others.

                    <small>Integra Telecom</small>
                    <p>
                      When I started at Integra I had no prior knowledge of relational databases, so I spent the first day devoting
                      myself to learning concepts and how to code in SQL. By the end of the first day I was starting to work on simple
                      tasks, and within a couple of weeks I was up to speed with the team and starting to work on relevant projects.
                      The experience I gained there was immensely helpful for me in terms of knowing how to work alone and with a team in a
                      professional environment.

                    <small>Saltire Software</small>
                    <p>
                      This was my first real experience working 8 hours a day. Although I wasn't directly coding, I used their proprietary
                      software to create an eBook version of Euclid's Elements with interactive colored diagrams that helped users
                      understand the proofs in the book. Thanks to this experience, I found my passion for software engineering.

                <hr>
                <p>
                  I enjoy a variety of hobbies outside of school and work. When I have time I like to socialize with friends over
                  some video or board games (Diablo and League tend to be the most common). If I'm eating at my desk or just spending
                  some time by myself, I like to watch videos from Rooster Teeth and Achievement Hunter. Whenever I'm back in Portland
                  I like to go on hikes with friends to see the sights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also like to build with my hands. Sometimes I'll look up a recipe and try to create a fancy dish for dinner, and
                  hope that I succeed. Othertimes an idea for a small trinket will strike me and I'll find the materials and give it
                  a shot. Usually I'll end up mixing in ideas from the games and shows I like, such as a AI bottle necklace for Red vs. Blue),
                  or a carved wooden plaque depicting a scene from the game Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery.
