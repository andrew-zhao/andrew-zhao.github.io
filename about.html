                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I'm a 3rd year CS student at University of California, Berkeley, and I'm interested in both front-end and back-end design. I grew up in Portland, OR, and chose to come to Berkeley to maximize my chances of learning interesting new things. I enjoy working on challenging projects, whether alone or collaborating with a team. In my free time I enjoy watching videos, playing games with friends and working on small handiwork projects.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>As a Junior at UC Berkeley, I've had the opportunity to experience the theory side of computer science. I've learned about core topics ranging from high-level (Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures) to low-level (Assembly language, processor design, operating systems). The deeper I dive into the more specific upper-division courses, the more I feel fascinated by all of the different fields in CS. In only a semester I've had the chance to learn about different algorithms (graph search, dynamic programming, P/NP) as well as ways to teach a robot to learn (Bayes Nets, machine learning).</p>

                <h2>My <span style="color:#0074d9">Experience</span></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I've done two full internships to date (two others I did were "volunteer experience") and I've learned a great deal from both of them. When I was at Saltire Software in 2012 through the ASE program, I had my first real experience waking up everyday, working for 8 hours, then heading home. Not what one would call an ideal summer schedule for a high school student, but I really enjoyed having the chance to use Geometry Software to make a colored, interactive eBook version of Euclid's Elements. I still feel a little of the same excitement when I think back on the hours spent reading the text and designing the improved diagrams.</p>
                <p>My other internship was at Integra Telecom in 2015. I joined the Business Intelligence team, despite having no knowledge of relational databases at the time. My boss gave me a book about SQL Server, and within a couple weeks I was working with team members to develop and test queries. By the time a month had passed I was working with customers to develop and deploy queries and data sources that they needed. On top of all that, I learned a lot about the corporate experience. Despite the commute, I really enjoyed working at Integra, and I'm extremely thankful to everyone I met for being very friendly and helpful.</p>

                <h2>My <span style="color:#0074d9">Hobbies</span></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I enjoy a variety of hobbies outside of school and work. When I have time I like to socialize with friends over some video or board games (Diablo and League tend to be the most common). If I'm eating at my desk or just spending some time by myself, I like to watch videos from Rooster Teeth and Achievement Hunter (<a href="https://roosterteeth.com/show/red-vs-blue"><span style="color:#0074d9">Red vs. Blue</span></a> is my favorite show ever. Of all time.). Whenever I'm back in Portland I like to go on hikes with friends to see the sights.</p>
                <p>I also like to build with my hands. Sometimes I'll look up a recipe and try to create a fancy dish for dinner, and hope that I succeed. Othertimes an idea for a small trinket will strike me and I'll find the materials and give it a shot. Usually I'll end up mixing in ideas from the games and shows I like, such as a AI bottle necklace for Red vs. Blue (pictured above), or a carved wooden plaque depicting a scene from the game Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery.</p>
                <p>Recently I've picked up a new 'hobby' where I spend time every week maintaining and updating this website as well as the website for my sister's non-profit organization, the <a href="kidsfirstproject.org"><span style="color:#0074d9">Kids First Project</span></a>. If you have time, please go check it out, it's a wonderful cause!</p>
